                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">What to expect:</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-black">
                    Immediately after your lip blush treatment your lips will appear more swollen and darker than
                    expected.
                    The colour will soften up to 50% in the next 7-10 days. Your lips will feel tingly and quite tender
                    and
                    dry. Your lips will also feel and look swollen after the treatment. This will only last for a few
                    days.
                    You can use an ice pack 3- 4 times a day to soothe your lips although be sure to use a clean barrier
                    like a tissue between the ice pack and your lips to avoid infection.
